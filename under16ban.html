    <h1>Australia's Under 16 Social Media Ban is a Terrible Idea That Won't Work</h1>

    <p>The government's age verification plan is a poorly thought-out surveillance scheme that invades everyone's privacy, while doing almost nothing to actually protect the youth.</p>

    <h2>Privacy Nightmare for Ordinary Users</h2>
    <p>This age verification system creates serious problems for regular users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Massive Data Collection:</strong> <span class="strong-point">It's outrageous that we'd be forced to hand over sensitive documents to private companies that can't even keep their own systems secure.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Anonymous Browsing:</strong> <span class="strong-point">They're trying to eliminate online anonymity, putting whistleblowers, journalists, and vulnerable people at risk.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Mission Creep is Guaranteed:</strong> <span class="strong-point">We all know this system won't stop at age verification, it's the start for broader monitoring and control.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Dangerous Step Toward Surveillance</h2>
    <p>This approach pushes us toward a monitored dystopian internet:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Creating Digital Barriers:</strong> <span class="strong-point">Why do we need to show ID just to use the internet? This is disturbing on so many levels.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Ineffective and Intrusive:</strong> <span class="strong-point">The methods they're proposing either don't work properly or create dangerous security issues.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Github...</h2>
    <p>They want to ban fucking GitHub. This proposal shows how little the policymakers understand technology:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Damaging Education:</strong> <span class="strong-point">Do I need to explain this one?</span></li>
        <li><strong>Revealing Ignorance:</strong> <span class="strong-point">The fact they can't tell the difference between social media and development tools says everything about their competence.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>It Completely Fails Its Supposed Purpose</h2>
    <p>This won't protect anyone:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Easy to Circumvent:</strong> <span class="strong-point">Any moderately tech-savvy 13 year old can bypass these measures in minutes. <b>They're not stupid.</b></span></li>
        <li><strong>Missing the Real Problem:</strong> <span class="strong-point">They're ignoring the actual harms of platform design that affect everyone.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Creating False Security:</strong> <span class="strong-point">This gives parents a false sense of security while making the internet worse for everyone.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The eSafety Commissioner's Concerning Power Grab</h2>
    <p>Recent actions make it clear this is about control, not protection:</p>
    
    <p>The Commissioner's use of legal powers to go after critics reveals where the priorities really show through. When "safety" systems are used to silence criticism, we should be worried.</p>
    
    <img src="esafety_admission.jpg" alt="eSafety Commissioner admission of using powers to silence criticism" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
    
    <a href="https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/services/access-to-files-and-transcripts/online-files/esafety-commissioner-v-x-corp/nsd-474-of-2024/Affidavit-of-T-Dagg-affirmed-9-May-2024.pdf">View document</a>
    <p>The fact that critics are being documented and targeted shows how protection frameworks can be twisted into tools for controlling speech.</p>
    <p>This pattern makes it clear the age verification push is less about protection and more about establishing control. The fact they'd even consider restricting platforms like GitHub shows how little they understand the internet.</p>
    
    <h2>There ahouldnt be an eSafety commissioner. Parents need to parent their kids and be educated. No one asked for the commisioner.</h2>

    <div class="message-box">
        <h2 class="message-title">A Message to the eSafety Commissioner:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Let me be clear. No one asked for you. No one wants your overreach and tyrrany. You are ruining the free and open internet. People aren't going to comply with your digital ID laws.</li>
        <li>Any attempt to take down this legitimate criticism will be met with immediate re-upload, and there is nothing you can do anout it.</li>
        
        <li>There are absolutely no legal grounds for removal. Documenting your own public admissions and criticizing government overreach is protected speech. Your attempts to silence critics only prove my point.</li>
        
        <li>This will continue regardless of how many takedown notices you issue. The Streisand Effect makes sure that each and every attempt at censorship will only spread this message further.</li>
      
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This mandatory age verification scheme is bad policy that trades away our privacy for ineffective protection. The ridiculous overreach; including potentially restricting essential tools like GitHub; shows how poorly conceived this entire idea is. Meanwhile, the eSafety Commissioner's actions demonstrate disgusting, scary priorities that value control over actual safety.</p>
