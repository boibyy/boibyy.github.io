            <h2 class="text-center">The most advanced BoibyPhone ever. The most advanced smartphone phone ever.</h2>
            <p class="text-center"><strong>Starting at US$1199</strong> | <strong>AU$1999</strong></p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Two perfect sizes. One Pro experience.</h3>
            <p>The all-new <strong>BoibyPhone 11 Pro</strong> comes in two perfect forms:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BoibyPhone 11 Pro</strong> - a compact <strong>6.4-inch</strong> design that fits
                    comfortably in one hand.¹</li>
                <li><strong>BoibyPhone 11 Pro Max</strong> - an expansive <strong>7-inch</strong> display, our biggest
                    ever, for those who want the most immersive experience possible.¹</li>
            </ul>
            Each size is crafted from grade 5 titanium with precision-milled edges and our strongest glass yet. Every
            curve feels refined, every surface purposeful.</p>

            <p><strong>Colors:</strong> Obsidian - Silver - Pacific Blue</p>
            <p>BoibyPhone 11 Pro comes in the same Obsidian and Silver finishes found on BoibyPhone X, as well as a
                stunning new Pacific Blue.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>A brighter view of everything.</h3>
            <p>The BoibyPhone 11 Pro's <strong>Ultra OLED XDR</strong> display pushes brightness to new extremes at
                <strong>4000 nits</strong> peak outdoor brightness, <strong>25 percent brighter</strong> than BoibyPhone
                X.</p>
            <p>HDR content bursts with lifelike contrast, while refined pixel architecture improves outdoor visibility
                dramatically. With a <strong>0.5 Hz - 120 Hz adaptive refresh rate</strong>, scrolling is buttery smooth
                just like always, but even more battery-efficient. And NaturalTone adjusts white balance using a
                12-channel ambient sensor for the most natural viewing experience in any light.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Smarter selfies.</h3>
            <p>The new <strong>18 MP Front Camera</strong> introduces an f/1.6 aperture for better low-light shots and a
                new <strong>Photonic Engine 6</strong> that reframes your photo in real time.</p>
            <p>Even holding BoibyPhone 11 Pro vertically, the camera can automatically switch to <strong>horizontal
                    capture</strong>, ideal for group shots. When more people join the frame, it <strong>intelligently
                    zooms out</strong> to fit everyone in the shot.</p>

            <h3>Our most advanced camera system</h3>
            <p>8K 60fps HDR recording is now avaliable on BoibyPhone 11 Pro, taking the capability of filming video on
                BoibyPhone even further.</p>
            <p>BoibyPhone 11 Pro has improved image processing and a larger second-generation 96MP main sensor, as well
                as a 5x 48MP telephoto lens for up to 100x zoom, and a great 48MP 0.5x ultrawide camera.

                <hr>

            <h3>See the unseen.</h3>
            <p>The all-new <strong>Thermal Camera</strong> on BoibyPhone 11 Pro brings a new dimension of perception to
                your phone. It can measure the surface temperature of nearby objects or environments with remarkable
                precision - perfect for checking electronics, reading surface temperature, or assisting in creative AR
                workflows.</p>
            <p>Every thermal reading is <strong>processed on-device</strong>, never uploaded, with privacy safeguards
                built-in.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Performance to the highest point.</h3>
            <p>Intoducing the <strong>Boiby C11 Pro</strong> chip. Engineered on a new <strong>2 nm process</strong>, it
                delivers industry-leading efficiency and incredible raw power.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Up to 20 % faster CPU</strong> vs Boiby C10</li>
                <li><strong>Up to 30 % faster</strong> than <strong>Apple A19 Pro¹</strong>.</li>

                <li><strong>New 8-core GPU</strong>, now <strong>50 % faster overall</strong> and <strong>70 % faster in
                        real-time ray tracing</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Neural Engine gains 40 % faster machine-learning throughput for intelligent photo enhancement,
                on-device translation, and smart power management — all while consuming less energy than before.</p>

            <h3>All-day battery, and then some.</h3>
            <p>With a massive <strong>5079 mAh</strong> battery, fit into a compact 6.4-inch form-factor, BoibyPhone 11
                Pro lasts <strong>up to 10 % longer</strong> than BoibyPhone X.</p>
            <p>BoibyPhone 11 Pro Max has our biggest battery yet at 6033 mAh, and with incredible optimization from boibyOS it delivers the best battery in any smartphone, ever.
            <h4>Charging is faster too:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>90 W fast charging</strong> — 0 to 50 % in under 15-20 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>25 W wireless charging</strong> with magnetic alignment for optimal efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And yes, it still has a <strong>headphone jack</strong>. We're proud to give audio enthusiasts and everday users what they
                deserve, now upgraded for <strong>high-impedance headphones</strong> for improved lossless playback.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Stronger by design.</h3>
            <p>Our cutting-edge <strong>Boiby Glass</strong> is now on both sides, with nanocrystalline reinforcement providing
                <strong>3x better scratch resistance</strong> and <strong>2x better crack resistance</strong>. Combined
                with a precision-sealed aluminium frame, it's rated for <strong>IP69</strong> dust and water resistance
                - the highest in its class.³</p>
