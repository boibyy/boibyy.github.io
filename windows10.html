                <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
                <p>Windows 10 support is ending on October 14, 2025. This specific timer counts down to the final time of the final update.</p>
                <p>This does <strong>not</strong> mean your Windows 10 computer will no longer work; it will simply no longer recieve any security updates, which build up, and you may end up at risk.</p>
                <p>This also does <strong>not</strong> mean Windows 10 is immediately insecure. It will likely remain fine for a few more weeks or even months (don't count on it though). But as time passes, the issues will begin to add up.</p>
                <p>Don't care and want to stay on 10? That's fine. It's not the best idea though. And eventually software will stop supporting Windows 10, so be warned. However, you may have more options than you may think.</p>
            </div><br>
            <div>
                <h2>What can I do?</h2>
                <p>You have a few options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use Extended Security Updates: You may be eligible for extended security updates for one year until October 13, 2026.</li>
                    <li>Upgrade to Windows 11: Yes, yes, I know. But for some people this might be the correct option; however, many computers do not support it (more on this below).</li>
                    <li>Bypass Windows 11 upgrades: Computer not compatible with Windows 11? You can make it compatibile by flashing an ISO onto a USB using <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">Rufus</a>. You can even disable the forced Microsoft account requirement (yuck) with ease.</li>
                    <li>Use Windows 10 LTSC: If you want a less bloated, enterprise edition of Windows supported until 2029, you can install Windows 10 LTSC. Note that UWP apps may not work properly or at all and some features are missing. You will need to find a proper ISO and use <a href="https://massgrave.dev/">Massgrave</a> to get it for free <em>(shhh)</em>.</li>
                    <li>Use Linux. No, seriously. It's worth a try. You don't need that much technical skill to use it. It can be overwhelming to choose, but a great start is <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> or <a href="https://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a>. There are many more, ranging from simple and easy, to requiring a degree in CompSci and hours of free time.</li>
                    <li>Are you stubborn? You could simply <strong>keep using Windows 10.</strong> As much as Microsoft would like to, they can't stop you. It's just not the best idea; but if you absolutely must do this, please use good security practices and be cautious. Apps will lose support eventually too.</li>
                </ul>
            </div><br>

            <div>
                <h2>I'm a Mac/Linux user. Why should I care?</h2>
                <p>Even if you don't use Windows, the end of support for Windows 10 can still affect you in a few ways. Remember, </strong>40% of all computers still use Windows 10 as of October 2025.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>File sharing and collaboration: If you exchange files with Windows 10 users, you could have issues if they encounter security problems, unpatched vulnerabilities, or software incompatibilities.</li>
                    <li>Security ripple effect: With millions of PCs no longer receiving security updates, infected or compromised machines might spread malware, ransomware, or phishing attacks across networks that include non-Windows devices. Many business and schools still run it, and some of your friends and family may as well.</li>
                    <li>Massive e-waste potential: Millions of PCs will be retired or replaced simply because they can't run the latest supported OS (even though these limits are artificial, and as bypasses prove, they can run it just fine). This contributes to huge amounts of e-waste.</li>
                </ul>
